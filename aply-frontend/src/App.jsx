// TODO: This file acts as the main container for the APLY frontend application.
// It will handle the routing between different pages (Onboarding, Apply, etc.) and serve as the entry point for page components.
// Set up React Router for client-side navigation, define main app layout, and integrate global state management if needed.
// Include authentication checks, error boundaries, and core UI structure here.
