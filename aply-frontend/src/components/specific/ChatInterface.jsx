// TODO: This file implements the ChatInterface component, specific to the Apply page for handling unique question interactions.
// When the backend returns a 202 status with a question, this component will display the question in a chat-like interface, allow user input for answers, and submit the response to the backend to continue the application process.
// Handle conversation history, loading states, success/error messages, and auto-scroll to latest message.
// Integrate with useApi hook for API calls and ensure responsive layout with Tailwind.
