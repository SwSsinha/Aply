// TODO: This file implements the FileUpload component, specific to the Onboarding or Resume upload page.
// It will handle user resume file uploads, validating file types (PDF, DOCX), showing drag-and-drop interface, uploading to backend API (/api/upload-resume), displaying progress bar, and handling success/error messages.
// Integrate with useState for file state, useEffect for validation, and API call using the useApi hook.
// Ensure responsive design and accessibility.
