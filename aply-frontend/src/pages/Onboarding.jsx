// TODO: This file implements the Onboarding page, a major view in the APLY application for new user setup.
// It will guide users through uploading their resume using the FileUpload component, collecting any additional basic info if needed (e.g., name, email from resume parsing), and saving user data.
// Display onboarding steps, handle form validation, show loading states during uploads, and redirect to Apply page upon completion.
// Use components from shared and specific folders, and integrate with routing and API calls.
