/* TODO: This file is for global CSS styles that are not managed by Tailwind CSS for the APLY frontend.
It will contain custom CSS rules like keyframe animations for transitions (e.g., form loading spinner), custom font imports, or component-specific styles that can't be easily handled with utility classes.
Import this CSS file in the main entry points (App.jsx or main.jsx) to apply globally across the application.
Keep this file minimal, using Tailwind for most styling to maintain consistency. */
